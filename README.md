# Final Project Friendly Wheels
#### I created a car rental application made for the 4Geeks Academy Final Project.
The app allows registration, login, add/edit/delete rental cars, filter the list of rental cars by dates, price and/or seats, mark cars as favorites, view car details, make payment through a payment gateway, sending email with the rental receipt. In turn, it has a support Chatbot.

### Technology stack
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Formik, Sweet Alert2, Cloudinary, Python, Flask, Flask-JWT, Flask-Mail, Stripe, React-simple-chatbot, Styled Components.

### How to start?
1. Run the webpack server with `$ pipenv run start`
2. Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`
