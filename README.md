# Final Project Friendly Wheels
#### I created a car rental application made for the 4Geeks Academy Final Project.
The app allows registration, login, add/edit/delete rental cars, filter the list of rental cars by dates, price and/or seats, mark cars as favorites, view car details, make payment through a payment gateway, sending email with the rental receipt. In turn, it has a support Chatbot.

### Technology stack
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Formik, Sweet Alert2, Cloudinary, Python, Flask, Flask-JWT, Flask-Mail, Stripe, React-simple-chatbot, Styled Components.

### How to start?
1. Check your API live with `$ pipenv run start`
2. Once you run the pipenv run start command your API will start running live and you need to click in the "port 3001" and then clicking "port visibility" an then Public.
3. Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`
